Create the evaluation criteria for an exam question at high school level (9th grade). Given the question you must create a list of 1 to 4 evaluation criteria (depending on the length of the question) explaining what you expect the student to say in the following format:
"The student states that [evaluation criteria]"

Provide your result as a csv file in the format: The student states that [evaluation criteria 1], The student states that [evaluation criteria 2], The student states that [evaluation criteria 3]
Make sure that there is no puntuation inside each evaluation criteria.
