Answer all questions. Write your answers in the space provided.

1. Photosintesis is... (5pts) Photosynthesis is the process by which chlorophyll, 

carbon dioxide, and water. The of photosynthesis 

are glucose and oxygen.

What is osmosis? (5pts)

Osmosis molecules from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration through a semi-permeable membrane. This process is essential for the absorption of water by plant roots and the maintenance of cell turgor in 

animals.

Describe the strucccture of a DNA molecule. (10pts) DNA is a double-stranded helix made up of nucleotides. Each nucleotide contains a nitrogenous base, a sugar molecule, and a phosphate group. The nitrogenous bases include adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine, and they pair up in a specific way (A with T, and C with G) to form the "rungs" of the DNA ladder. The sugar-phosphate backbone forms the "sides" of the ladder.

What is natural selection? (10pts)

Question 5. What is mitosis? (5pts)

Mitosis 

is the process by whitch a single cell divides into two identical daughter cells. It involves several stages, including prophase, metaphase, anaphase, 

and telophase, and ensures that each daughter cell receives a complete set of 

6. What is the function of the respiratory system? (5pts)

The respiratory system is responsible for the exchange of gases between the body and the environment. It brings oxygen into the body and removes carbon dioxide and other waste gases.

Explain the process of meiosis. (10pts) Meiosis is a type of cell division that results in the formation of haploid cells (gametes) from diploid cells. The process involves two rounds of cell division, meiosis I and meiosis II, and produces four daughter cells that are genetically different from each other and from the parent cell. 

Meiosis I involves the separation of homologous chromosomes, while meiosis II involves the separation of sister chromatids. This results in the production of four genetically diverse haploid cells.
